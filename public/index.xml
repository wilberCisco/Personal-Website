      <description>iAmAlive Script iAmAlive script confirms if a host is reachable and triggers a collaborative action via Tropo; Tropo will send an sms to the network admin if the host is reachable or call the network admin if the host is unreachable.
The idea is to demonstrate the capabilities of APIC-EM 1 as well as Tropo APIs and how they can be leveraged on to facilitate collaboration within distributed teams.
 Flow  Prerequisites  Python Tropo Account with Outbound SMS and Call capabilities Access to an APIC-EM Platform 2   Code  configuration file (iAmAlive_config.</description>

      <description>Wilber O. Wanjira1 and Juma O.

SIP over MPLS will provide an alternative to SIP over dedicated Internet Access (the current and more typical deployment approach).</description>
