A list of good reads I believe every Engineer should read through in
striving to be a better Engineer. Will likely organize these better down
the line.

# Books
#### [Apollo](http://www.amazon.com/Apollo-Charles-Murray/dp/0976000806/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1435698385&sr=8-2&keywords=apollo)
How to do a bunch of "ambitious" things with lots of talented folks and
quickly at that\!
Here's a [fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY45YE7ggng) presentation on the Apollo Guidance Computer(AGC). Some fun facts:

  - AGC didn't have room for code to enforce invariants
  - AGC first human interactive interface
  - AGC first priority scheduler
  
> My favourite titbits: Engineers reported to engineers, metrics deck/project deck used to coordinate decentralized organization.

##### [Failure is not an Option](http://www.amazon.com/Failure-Not-Option-Mission-Control/dp/1439148813/)

How to hold all of those talented folks accountable while keeping an
especially daring few of them "safe."

* "Mission Controllers" were not chosen and then made
    meticulous; they were chosen because they were already meticulous.
    So the controller job role takes the "Bias for Action" principle and
    draws out its timeline from the near-term, get something -- anything
    -- done and turns that timeline into an anticipation and measurement
    of possible outcomes of action. The incredible volume of
    anticipation and procedures for dealing with problems is its own
    bias for action, but one we are usually too near-term focused to
    see.

* Kranz famously said that if you don't know what you're doing, you
    shouldn't do anything. The reason is simple: the law of unintended
    consequences coupled with Mr. Murphy's law means you're more likely
    to make a bad situation worse than make it better, so it's best to
    do the right thing in response, not just any thing. He learned this
    lesson, he claimed, with a Redstone booster full of kerosene/LOX
    sitting on the launch pad after a four-inch flight; the correct
    thing to do ended up being exactly nothing (waiting for the
    batteries to run down and vent off the LOX when the failsafe vents
    opened as a result).

#### [Complications](http://www.amazon.com/Complications-Surgeons-Notes-Imperfect-Science/dp/0312421702)

Why/How to guard against very talented people being temporarily or
occasionally less-than-talented.

The Mission Controllers of the space program represented that authority
holding everyone accountable. Namely, they used the mechanism of testing
Mission Rules (error scenarios) and tracking to the goal (keeping the
astronauts alive and on- mission). Then when the missions were underway,
they have the "boring" job of reading up the checklists and
cross-referencing the astronauts' work.

However, it has been pointed out to me that the Mission Controllers were
not chosen and then made conscientious; rather they were conscientious
first and made Mission Controllers later.

#### [Fooled by Randomness,](http://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219/) [Anti-Fragile](http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680/)

Stop falling into the traps of humans attempting analytical thought.

Start identifying risks and inure yourself/system to them.

*   Any view of reality is a simplification of some underlying system
    and that system is likely to be complex if it is all interesting.
    The underpinnings of that system are actually unknown and unknowable
    and are guaranteed to produce a "black swan" from time to time.
    Software systems undergoing constant change are create example of a
    system where any model is going to be somewhat wrong.

*   Perturbations of complex systems will produce results that were not
    anticipated by any models ("law" of unintended consequences);
    changing behaviour in such a system needs to be heavily monitored.

####  [Mythical Man Month](http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/)

Stop falling into the ubiquitous mental traps of humans attempting software development.
* More people almost always make a project take longer.
  - Adding them at the beginning is the only safe time to add them.
* The most expensive time to add people is at the end of a project.
* The most expensive time to find a bug is at the end of a project
milestone.
  - Debugging is an inherently serial task: more people never makes it
    go faster.
* Sunk Cost Fallacy: when comparing future costs between alternatives, you
cannot include the costs you have paid in the past.

# Non-Books

#### [NASA Systems Engineering Handbook](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_systems_engineering_handbook_0.pdf)

* Handbook that digs into every aspect of engineering a system from
    idea conception, requirements gathering, design, evaluating choices
    to readiness and release

#### [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)

* Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training,
    and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In
    contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful
    of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and
    never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat
    one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's
    successes**

* You will never win at software
* The best you can do is identify, track and pay off technical debt on a continuous busy so you don’t lose the game
